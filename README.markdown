# Kyle Wiest's Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, customized slightly but mostly stolen from people smarter than I. Currently, I'm using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) as a framework to build on.

For editing, I use VIM with the following plugins:

* Command-T: Fast file navigation
* Coffeescript: Syntax for Coffee-Script
* Endwise: Automatically (and smartly) and "end"
* Haml: Syntax for Haml
* Mustache.Vim: Syntax for Mustache.
* NERDCommenter: Easy comment manipulation.
* Rag Tag: Tim Pope's mappings for (X)HTML manipulation
* Rails: Self explanatory
* Supertab: Tab completion for current context
* Surround: Mappings to surround text in quotes, tags, etc.
* Tabular: Helps with auto-formatting tabs around characters
* Vim-Colors-Solarized: Solarized themes for gvim

## Installation
